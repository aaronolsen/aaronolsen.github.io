	<h1>5.5 Determining the calibration accuracy</h1>
	<p>
		The optimization should generally converge on a value (reconstruction error) less 
		than 1 for each minimization. This value is in pixels so regardless of the scale 
		of your setup this error should be less than 1. If for some reason a particular 
		set is not converging the function might stop running the minimization and switch 
		to the next set. If the optimization fails to converge for all of the sets there 
		is probably an error in the correspondence between the two corner sets. Most commonly 
		this is due to corners that are in different orders between two views or between 
		different aspects. The DLT coefficients corresponding to the optimization with the 
		lowest error will then be saved in the "calibration.txt" file as an 11x2 matrix.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the best calibration is selected, the <span class='in_line_code'>calibrateCameras()</span> tests the calibration 
		accuracy using all of the available calibration checkerboards. Note that these errors 
		are measured using the same checkerboard that was used for the calibration. 
		Therefore, they cannot be used to test whether the <strong>scaling</strong> of the calibration 
		is correct. To test the accuracy of the calibration including scaling it's best to 
		<a class='incomplete_link' href='testing_the_accuracy_using_a_second_checkerboard.html' >test the accuracy 
		using an additional checkerboard with a different square size</a>. The error diagnostics 
		are the same in both cases so they will be described in this section. This section will use the 
		<a href='calibration_photographs.html' >calibrating from photographs</a> 
		example to explain how to interpret the various calibration error tests.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the coefficient estimation, <span class='in_line_code'>calibrateCameras()</span> 
		prints a "dltTestCalibration Summary":

</pre></div>

	<p>
		This read-out summarizes four main error measurements:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Aligned ideal to reconstructed (AITR) errors</strong>: The AITR error aligns an 
			ideal (perfect) checkerboard to the reconstructed corners using least squares 
			alignment. Then, the distance is measured between each ideal checkerboard corner 
			and its corresponding reconstructed corner. If the corners were perfectly 
			reconstructed, the ideal and reconstructed points would overlap perfectly. The 
			"AITR RMS errors" are the alignment errors along each dimension (x,y,z) 
			in the coordinate system of the calibration points. This coordinate system 
			depends on the orientation of the first checkerboard so it is somewhat arbitrary. 
			But if you have larger error along one dimension than another it will generally 
			show up here. For the tutorial project the error is greatest along the z-axis 
			but overall the mean errors are low (less than 25 microns along any dimension).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Inter-point distance (IPD) errors</strong>: The IPD error summarizes distance 
			rather than positional errors. For every reconstructed checkerboard, random 
			pairs of points (without re-sampling) are chosen and the distance between them 
			is compared to the distance on an ideal checkerboard. Unlike AITR error, this 
			measure doesn't allow a comparison of the error along different dimensions. 
			Additionally, while a range of different lengths are used to calculate the error 
			the lengths can only be as large as the checkerboard. The IPD error should be 
			about the same order of magnitude as the AITR error. For the tutorial project 
			the IPD error is less than 20 microns. The reconstructed distances can be either 
			shorter or longer than the actual distance. The "Mean IPD error" takes 
			the simple mean of these errors: If there is no bias toward over- or 
			underestimation of distance this should be near zero.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Adjacent-pair distance errors</strong>: This is identical to IPD error except 
			that the error is determined only using pairs of adjacent checkerboard corners. 
			This means the ideal distances are uniform and the same size as the square size. 
			Since the corners in each pair are uniformly close together, their mean position 
			(the mid-point) can be used to look at how IPD error varies as a function of 
			position in the calibration volume.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Epipolar errors</strong>: For two cameras arranged in stereo a point in one 
			camera view must fall along a line in a second camera view. This line is that 
			point's epipolar line. The distance between a point's epipolar line and its 
			corresponding point in that second camera view is the epipolar error. Since the 
			error is a measure of distance between a line and point in the image plane 
			the units are pixels.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		It's important to consider the magnitude of these errors relative to the pixel 
		resolution of the cameras and the size of the calibrated volume. For the tutorial 
		project the image resolution is around 30 microns/pixel (using 12 MP cameras). 
		Since digitized coordinates are limited to pixel resolution the reconstructed errors 
		should always be greater 30 microns. Note that the calibration errors can be lower 
		than this because the checkerboard corners are detected to subpixel resolution by 
		sampling a small window of pixels around each internal corner and fitting a sub-pixel 
		corner position. Also, the calibrated volume is approximately 60 mm x 80 mm x 100 
		mm. Thus, the mean distance (IPD) error is less than 0.03% of the length along 
		any one dimension of the space.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to the error summary read-out, <span class='in_line_code'>calibrateCameras()</span> 
		creates several error diagnostic plots for a complete assessment of the error. These will be saved in a 
		folder "Error tests" within the same folder as the "calibration.txt" 
		file (if the "Error tests" folder doesn't exist before running 
		<span class='in_line_code'>calibrateCameras()</span> one will be created). The plots 
		for the tutorial calibration can be found in "Run 1/Calibrate/Error tests".
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, the function creates a boxplot of the IPD errors, separated by aspect 
		(left) and a histogram of the IPD errors (right) pooled from all aspects.
	</p>
	<img width='700px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/calib_error_diagnostics_ipd.jpg' />
	<p>
		And the equivalent plots for epipolar error:
	</p>
	<img width='700px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/calib_error_diagnostics_epipolar.jpg' />
	<p>
		The function creates a plot of the IPD error as a function of the length between 
		the two corners being measured to verify that error is not strongly correlated with 
		the length being measured.
	</p>
	<img width='500px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/ipd_error_error_v_length.jpg' />
	<p>
		The function also uses all the reconstructed corners to identify the major axes 
		through the calibration volume and plots the IPD error as a function of the position 
		along each of these major axes. This is an easy way to get an idea of the size of 
		the total calibrated volume and check whether the error is greater along one 
		dimension than another.
