	<h1>4.1 Arranging cameras for stereo photography</h1>
	<p>
		The basic idea behind a stereo camera setup is to use information from two 
		different views of the same object in order to reconstruct features visible in both 
		views into 3D. A single view or image of an object has a information on the shape 
		of features along the two dimensions of the image plane but not along the third 
		dimension (going into and out of the image plane). Thus, by combining the information 
		from two different views it is possible to obtain  three-dimensional information 
		on position and shape.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are a number of ways to arrange cameras in stereo. This section will outline 
		some general considerations to help you determine which camera arrangement will 
		work best for your application. Once you've found a configuration that works well 
		for your application, make sure you check its accuracy (either using the 
		<a href='calibration_accuracy.html' >calibration images</a> 
		or a <a href='test_accuracy_checkerboard.html' >separate set of images</a> 
		before collecting data.
	</p>

	<p>
		Materials needed for this section:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>2 cameras (see <a href='choosing_cameras_general.html' >Choosing cameras for stereo photography</a>)</li>
		<li>Camera remotes</li>
		<li>2 sturdy tripods</li>
		<li>Tape</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		General considerations in arranging the cameras:
	</p>
	<p>
		1. The views among the cameras must overlap such that the feature or features of 
		interest are visible in both camera views. If you want to collect data on features 
		around an entire object (for example the top, side and bottom of a skull) you can 
		rotate the specimen and take two or more pairs of photographs of the same object. 
		You'll end up with two or more separate sets of landmarks and/or curves. As long 
		as there are three or more landmarks common among the different sets these can be 
		aligned, or "unified", based on these common landmarks into a single set. 
		StereoMorph has a function that will do this automatically, which will be detailed 
		in <a href='reconstructing_landmarks.html' >Unification of reconstructed sets</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		2. Theoretically, there is a trade-off between the ease of digitizing and reconstruction 
		accuracy. For instance, if the angle between two camera views in a stereo setup is 90 degrees,
	</p>

	<img width='500px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/cameras_at_90_degrees.jpg' />
	<div class='img_caption' >
		Two-camera stereo setup with the cameras at 90 degrees relative to one another.
	</div>

	<p>
		you will have high reconstruction accuracy (together, the two views give you full 
		information on a point's position along all three axes) however the views will be 
		so divergent that it will be difficult to identify the same point in both views. 
		A point visible in one view may not even be visible in the other. If the angle 
		between two cameras is reduced to around 20 degrees
	</p>

	<img width='500px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/cameras_at_20_degrees.jpg' />
	<div class='img_caption' >
		Two-camera stereo setup with the cameras at 20 degrees relative to one another.
	</div>

	<p>
		it's much easier to find the same point in both views (the views are nearly the same), 
		however these slight differences in position are now the only information available 
		on the point's position along the depth axis (orthogonal to the image planes). In 
		practice, I've found that cameras positioned with a small angle relative to one 
		another still provide high reconstruction accuracy but do not work as well for 
		curve reconstruction. It's best to start with the cameras as close together as 
		possible (more convergent views), test the accuracy and make the views more divergent 
		if the accuracy is worse than what you're willing to accept.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cameras were arranged as shown below for the accompanying example project.
	</p>

	<img width='300px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/stereo_camera_setup_side_by_side.jpg' />
	<div class='img_caption' >
		One possible camera arrangement.
	</div>

	<p>
		This is a nice setup because the orientation of both views is the same. By moving 
		the cameras and changing the angle you can change the extent of divergence between 
		the views. Also the table provides an easy place to set the objects and lights. An 
		alternative setup is to have one camera on the tabletop and the other camera on the 
		floor.
	</p>

	<img width='300px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/stereo_camera_setup_top_side.jpg' />
	<div class='img_caption' >
		An alternative camera arrangement.
	</div>

	<p>
		A disadvantage to this setup is that the view from one camera will be "upside-down" 
		relative to the other. You can flip all of the images once they're loaded on your 
		computer to compensate for this.
	</p>

	<p>
		3. It is <em>essential</em> that the cameras not move during the entire process of 
		calibration and photographing specimens. The cameras can be calibrated before or 
		after data collection but throughout and between these steps the cameras must 
		remain in the exact same position. Because the camera is often positioned half 
		a meter or more away from the object, even a small shift of the camera can translate 
		into a large shift in the image frame, causing large inaccuracies.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you position a tripod on a smooth surface, such as a table top, put small rubber 
		squares under each tripod foot to keep the tripod from slipping.
	</p>

	<img width='500px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/rubber_under_tripod_foot.jpg' />

	<p>
		4. Before you take any photographs, you can attach small pieces of tape to the 
		tabletop or some other fixed surface within the calibration space and visible 
		from both camera views.
	</p>

	<img width='500px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/camera_stability_check.jpg' />

	<p>
		By taking a photograph from both views before you begin and then after you have 
		finished photographing all objects with a particular calibration you can compare 
		the before and after photographs to be sure that both cameras remained motionless 
		throughout the photographing process.
	</p>
	<p>
		5. Just as the cameras should not move during the entire process of calibration and 
		object photographing, the camera settings themselves should not change. This 
		includes the zoom (focal length) and the focus. The calibration is specific to a 
		particular focal length and focus, so if either of these changes the calibration 
		will no longer be accurate. Additionally, if your lens has vibration reduction (VR) 
		you should turn this off. Vibration reduction uses a small gyroscope in the lens 
		to compensate for camera motion and reduce blur. The spinning and stopping of the 
		gyroscope can cause the image frame to shift randomly while taking photos.
	</p>

	<img width='500px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/autofocus_and_vr_off.jpg' />
	<div class='img_caption' >
		Turn off auto-focus and vibration reduction, if applicable.
	</div>

	<p>
		6. It's best to use a remote (wireless or cord) to release the shutter so you 
		minimizing touching the shutter button on the cameras as much as possible.
	</p>

	<img width='400px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/camera_remotes.jpg' />
	<div class='img_caption' >
		Shutter remotes lessen the chances of the cameras moving during data collection.
	</div>

	<p>
		I've found that pressing buttons on the camera lightly (such as for reviewing photos) 
		doesn't cause significant movement of the cameras but pressing the shutter button 
		requires more force and doing it repeatedly causes the cameras to move significantly 
		over a series of photographs. A wireless remote is the best option since you can 
		trigger both cameras with one remote (note that if the objects you are photographing 
		are not moving the photographs do not have to be taken simultaneously).
	</p>
	<p>
		7. Make sure that all connections and screws in the tripod and between the tripod 
		and the camera are tight. This reduces the possibility of any motion of the cameras 
		during data collection.
	</p>

	<img width='500px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/tighten_connections.jpg' />
	<div class='img_caption' >
		Ensure tight connections in the tripod and between the tripod and camera.
	</div>

	<p>
		8. Set the cameras to the smallest aperture (this is the largest f-value).
	</p>

	<img width='400px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/minimum_aperture.jpg' />
	<div class='img_caption' >
		A smaller aperture is ideal because it increases depth of field. Without increasing the lighting, the exposure time will increase.
	</div>

	<p>
		The smaller the aperture, the greater the depth of field (i.e. the more things are 
		in focus both close and far away from the camera). This is essential in a stereo 
		camera setup because in order to digitize points accurately throughout the calibration 
		volume they must be in focus.
	</p>

	<p>
		9. If possible, set your camera to manual mode.
	</p>

	<img width='200px' class='center' src='../../img/tutorials/stereomorph/manual_mode.jpg' />
	<div class='img_caption' >
		Manual mode on a Nikon.
	</div>

	<p>
		This allows you to control both the aperture and shutter speed. Once you have the 
		cameras arranged take some sample photos of the objects to find a good shutter speed 
		(exposure) for your lighting. I've found that the automatic exposure on my camera 
		is not always reliable and that it's better to simply have the same exposure throughout.
