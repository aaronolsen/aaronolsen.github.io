				Bird beaks are frequently invoked as a classic example of adaptive evolution to feeding ecology. 
				However, most studies of feeding evolution in birds have focused  
				on Passerines, which represent only half of all avian diversity.
				And, with the exception of Darwin's finches, there are few bird groups in which 
				we have an integrated understanding of how the feeding system has evolved.
				Waterfowl (Anseriformes) are a diverse and globally distributed order of birds 
				that includes ducks, geese, swans, and mergansers.
				Owing to their economic and agricultural importance, 
				more is known about the diets of waterfowl than perhaps any other bird order. 
				Waterfowl also exhibit a diversity of beak shapes and feeding behaviors.
				For these reasons waterfowl are an ideal model system for understanding the  
				evolution of an avian feeding system and for testing classic hypotheses on the link between 
				beak shape and feeding ecology.

				As a major part of my PhD thesis I integrated diet data compiled from the literature, 
				and beak shape data collected from natural history specimens to 
				examine patterns of ecological and morphological evolution in waterfowl.
				Compiling dietary data from over 200 quantitative published studies, I 
				showed that waterfowl have undergone at least five independent transitions 
				to a more herbivorous diet and that these increases in a less digestible diet 
				are uncorrelated with changes in body mass 
				(<a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1787/full' target='_blank' >Olsen 2015</a>).
				I combined this continuous dietary dataset with 3D geometric morphometric data 
				to quantify how much of dietary diversity is explained by beak shape 
				and to identify the axes of shape and dietary variation mostly strongly 
				associated with one another (Olsen, <i>in review</i>).
				I will be combining the beak shape data with morphometric data from the rest 
				of the skull to test the strength of morphological integration between the beak 
				and the rest of the skull, in the context of ecological adaptation of the beak.
