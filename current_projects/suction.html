				Suction feeding is the oldest and most widespread feeding strategy among the Osteichthyes (bony fishes). 
				Fish suction feed by rapidly expanding the buccal
				cavity to create a negative pressure gradient, which drives the flow of water and 
				nearby prey items into the mouth. 
				It has recently been shown that 95% of the power required for suction feeding in largemouth 
				bass is generated by the axial muscles that span most of the body and also function in swimming 
				(<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icv034' target='_blank' >Camp and Brainerd 2014</a>; 
				<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1508055112' target='_blank' >Camp et al. 2015</a>).
				These muscles pull on the back of the head and cause the mouth to expand 
				through a three-dimensional linkage of mobile cranial bones.
				Whether locomotor muscles provide most of the power in other suction-feeding 
				ray-finned fishes remains unknown.
				Additionally, if largemouth bass are representative of other suction feeding fishes, 
				how motor coordination between cranial and postcranial functional systems has 
				influenced the diversification of body forms among fishes also remains unknown.

				For my postdoctoral research I am integrating <i>in vivo</i>, modeling, and 
				collections-based approaches to understand how the biomechanics of suction 
				feeding has influenced the diversification of body forms in ray-finned fishes. 
				Working with Beth Brainerd (Brown University) and Ariel Camp (Brown University) I will be measuring <i>in vivo</i> 
				kinematics and buccal pressures from four species of ray-finned fishes. 
				I will use these <i>in vivo</i> data to validate a computational model 
				of cranial linkage kinematics and force transmission during suction feeding, 
				expanding on work I began during as a part of my PhD thesis with Mark Westneat (University of Chicago).
				These models will then be applied to CT scans of a diverse sample of ray-finned 
				fishes natural history collections to predict cranial linkage movements and 
				suction performance and test how motor coordination 
				between the head and trunk for suction feeding relates to variation in 
				body forms across ray-finned fishes.
